{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>An excerpt from Paul Graham's <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/icad.html\">\"Revenge of the Nerds\" essay</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Within large organizations, the phrase used to describe [the safe approach] is \"industry best practice.\" Its purpose is to shield the pointy-haired boss from responsibility: if he chooses something that is \"industry best practice,\" and the company loses, he can't be blamed. He didn't choose, the industry did.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I believe this term was originally used to describe accounting methods and so on. What it means, roughly, is don't do anything weird. And in accounting that's probably a good idea. The terms \"cutting-edge\" and \"accounting\" do not sound good together. But when you import this criterion into decisions about technology, you start to get the wrong answers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Technology often should be cutting-edge. In programming languages, as Erann Gat has pointed out, what \"industry best practice\" actually gets you is not the best, but merely the average. When a decision causes you to develop software at a fraction of the rate of more aggressive competitors, \"best practice\" is a misnomer.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"date":"2017-07-11T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Industry Best Practice"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/posts/industry-best-practice"}}
