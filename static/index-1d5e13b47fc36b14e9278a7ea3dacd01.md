I walk down a slanted sidewalk

steam twists into chaos from the manhole in the middle of the street

A cold wind rushes over my face and locks itself around my ears

but brings with it a hint of perfume from a passerby

I recognize

from a high school crush

A neural pathway in my brain lights up

from so many years ago

I see her room

a small cluttered make up dresser in the corner

a bed with white sheets

and a tapestry hanging behind it

and a Macbook perpetually buried in the linens

and me, with her, falling asleep watching Breakfast Club

on a school night

It was a deadline night for the school paper

And I had driven to her house after

"It was a late night," I would tell my parents later

It would be true,

partially.

"You twitch when you sleep," she said.

"It's cute."

I wasn't sure I believed her

but I was too tired to say that

so I pulled her closer

and closed my eyes again

I got up ten minutes later

kissed her

and left

and drove home

on Lee Boulevard

with my windows down

radio off

in the cool, cicada-humming darkness

driving fifty in a thirty

because I liked the way the wind felt.

An ambulance horn squeals

and brings me back to the sidewalk

the smell is gone

but the cold is not

and I continue walking

feeling the smell

the memory

fade gently

into the air.
