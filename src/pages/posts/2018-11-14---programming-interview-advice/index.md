## Goal
Get a job as a software engineer.

## How to Prepare

Find an interview prep website and make an effort to use it a few times a week. I recommend [InterviewCake][1] because they offer a nice variety of questions with solutions in 7+ different languages. There are a ton of other options out there, too.

When using any of these sites, try to write your own solution to the question before looking at any hints or the provided solution.

Consider using the a slightly modified version of the [STAR approach][2], adapted to programming questions:

### Situation

Before writing any code, try to answer the following questions:

- What is the problem asking me to do?
- Do I need to make any assumptions about the problem for my solution to work?
- Is there a type of algorithm (greedy, recursive, dynamic programming, etc.) or data structure (stacks, queues, trees, hashtables, etc.) that is best fit for this problem?

Additionally, brainstorm some potential clarifying questions you could ask an interviewer. **Asking questions is a good thing.** It demonstrates you are thinking critically about the problem. They want to understand how you approach a question. Some examples:

- Can I assume the input data will be sorted?
- Do I have to account for potentially null input values?
- Are there any space or time constraints on the problem?

### Task

Stub out the function(s) you plan on implementing and then **vocalize your plan to the interviewer.**

*"But evan I don't have an interviewer around to practice with"*

In that case, recruit a classmate or friend (imaginary or real) to practice with. Or the pencil case sitting on your desk, it doesn't matter. During an actual interview, this is a doubly useful activity:

1. It forces you to think holistically about your solution
2. It gives the interview some context as to what they're about to see.

The interview may even use this as a time to clarify a part of the problem, or start a discussion about what you proposed.

### Action

Begin coding. Regarding languages: Python, C++, Java are the traditional “programming interview” languages, but feel free to branch out if you prefer to use another language. As a student, I used Javascript for my interviews because it was the language I knew best at the time.

Don't rush, but keep an eye on the clock. It's OK to be less vocal at this time, but don't go radio silent on your interviewer. In most cases, they do NOT want to observe you code silently for 30 minutes. Ask questions if you get stuck, try to talk through certain pieces of your solution whose purpose may not be obvious from the code alone.

### Resolution

Evaluate your solution.

- Does it work?
- Did you answer the question as it was originally stated?
- What is the space and runtime complexity of your solution?
- Can you spot any ways to make it more efficient?
- How would you test the program?


### An Example Interview.

### Closing

It's counterintuitive, but programming interviews are really only about 25% programming. The majority of your time is spent communicating with your interviewer, so be sure to make that an integral part of your preparation.
