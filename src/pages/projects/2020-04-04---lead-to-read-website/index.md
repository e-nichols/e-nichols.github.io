Howdy folks. It's been a hot minute since I posted last. That's because I've worked on a big website redesign for the past few months.

The Lead to Read website is a Wordpress site is SEO optimized, but quite slow and in need of a UI refresh.

Lighthouse scores.

Not mobile optimized.

I reached out to the president of Lead to Read (a family friend) and offered to redo the website. A refresh for them, a learning experience and chance to do some fulfilling volunteer work for me. Win win right?

I worked with Martha and Pauly to give the site a total makeover, with responsive design in mind.

Mobile first styling.

Consistent spacing system.

Simplicity, readability.
