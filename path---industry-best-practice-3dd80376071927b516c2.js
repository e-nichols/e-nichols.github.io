He didn’t choose, the industry did.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I believe this term was originally used to describe accounting methods and so on. What it means, roughly, is don’t do anything weird. And in accounting that’s probably a good idea. The terms “cutting-edge” and “accounting” do not sound good together. But when you import this criterion into decisions about technology, you start to get the wrong answers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Technology often should be cutting-edge. In programming languages, as Erann Gat has pointed out, what “industry best practice” actually gets you is not the best, but merely the average. When a decision causes you to develop software at a fraction of the rate of more aggressive competitors, “best practice” is a misnomer.</p>\n</blockquote>',timeToRead:1,tableOfContents:"",fields:{tagSlugs:["/tags/paul-graham/","/tags/best-practices/"]},frontmatter:{title:"Industry Best Practice",tags:["Paul Graham","best practices"],date:"July 11, 2017",author:{id:"Evan Nichols",bio:"Software Engineer and outdoor enthusiast.
