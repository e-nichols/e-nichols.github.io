He didn’t choose, the industry did.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I believe this term was originally used to describe accounting methods and so on. What it means, roughly, is don’t do anything weird. And in accounting that’s probably a good idea. The terms “cutting-edge” and “accounting” do not sound good together. But when you import this criterion into decisions about technology, you start to get the wrong answers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Technology often should be cutting-edge. In programming languages, as Erann Gat has pointed out, what “industry best practice” actually gets you is not the best, but merely the average. When a decision causes you to develop software at a fraction of the rate of more aggressive competitors, “best practice” is a misnomer.</p>\n</blockquote>',timeToRead:1,tableOfContents:"",fields:{tagSlugs:["/tags/paul-graham/","/tags/best-practices/"]},frontmatter:{title:"Industry Best Practice",tags:["Paul Graham","best practices"],date:"July 11, 2017",author:{id:"Evan Nichols",bio:"Software Engineer out of NYC writing about programming, web development and more.",avatar:{children:[{__typename:"ImageSharp",responsiveResolution:{src:"/static/evan-9e6a6b67e58d77cd1bc023a71bd56378-c4f5a.jpg",srcSet:"/static/evan-9e6a6b67e58d77cd1bc023a71bd56378-c4f5a.jpg 1x,\n/static/evan-9e6a6b67e58d77cd1bc023a71bd56378-27112.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/evan-9e6a6b67e58d77cd1bc023a71bd56378-f5e46.jpg 2x,\n/static/evan-9e6a6b67e58d77cd1bc023a71bd56378-592c8.jpg 3x"}}]}}}}},pathContext:{slug:"/posts/industry-best-practice/"}}}});
