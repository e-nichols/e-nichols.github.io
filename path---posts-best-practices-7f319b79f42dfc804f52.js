Its purpose is to shield the pointy-haired boss from responsibility: if he chooses something that is "industry best practice," and the company loses, he can\'t be blamed. He didn\'t choose, the industry did.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I believe this term was originally used to describe accounting methods and so on. What it means, roughly, is don\'t do anything weird. And in accounting that\'s probably a good idea. The terms "cutting-edge" and "accounting" do not sound good together. But when you import this criterion into decisions about technology, you start to get the wrong answers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Technology often should be cutting-edge. In programming languages, as Erann Gat has pointed out, what "industry best practice" actually gets you is not the best, but merely the average. When a decision causes you to develop software at a fraction of the rate of more aggressive competitors, "best practice" is a misnomer.</p>\n</blockquote>',frontmatter:{title:"Industry Best Practice"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/posts/best-practices/"}}}});
