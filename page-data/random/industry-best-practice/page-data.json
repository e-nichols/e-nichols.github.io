He didn’t choose, the industry did.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I believe this term was originally used to describe accounting methods and so on. What it means, roughly, is don’t do anything weird. And in accounting that’s probably a good idea. The terms “cutting-edge” and “accounting” do not sound good together. But when you import this criterion into decisions about technology, you start to get the wrong answers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Technology often should be cutting-edge. In programming languages, as Erann Gat has pointed out, what “industry best practice” actually gets you is not the best, but merely the average. When a decision causes you to develop software at a fraction of the rate of more aggressive competitors, “best practice” is a misnomer.</p>\n</blockquote>","timeToRead":1,"tableOfContents":"","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/random/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Industry Best Practice","tags":["random"],"date":"2017-07-11T00:12:03.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/random/industry-best-practice"}}}
